Installation
==============

Prerequisites
***************

- Administrator or ``sudo`` privileges (Linux/macOS).
- ``GitHub`` account created.
- ``git`` installed on your system.
- Ensure ``pip`` is installed.
- Internet access to download dependencies.


Step 1: Install Python
----------------------------

If you already have ``Python`` installed, you can skip this step. To check your ``Python`` version,
open a terminal and type:


.. code:: bash

    python3 --version


If the output is ``command not found: python3``, or the version is lower than ``Python 3.12``,
then you will need to install Python.

.. md-tab-set::
  :class: custom-tab-set-style
  :name: installation_python

  .. md-tab-item:: MacOS

      To install Python, download the appropriate installer from:
      `MacOS Installer Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/>`_.

      Once the install has finished, check to make sure that it's using the correct version:

      .. code:: bash

        python3 --version
          # Expected output:
          # Python 3.12.* or higher

  .. md-tab-item:: Linux

      To install Python, use your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, type:

      .. code-block:: bash

          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install python3.12

      Once the install has finished, check to make sure that it's using the correct version:

      .. code:: bash

        python3 --version
        # Expected output:
        # Python 3.12.* 

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows Command Prompt

      To install Python, download the installer from:
      `Windows Installer Python 
      <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_.

      .. note::

        For other distributions, refer to your distribution's documentation.

      Once the installation has finished, check to make sure that it's using the correct version:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 --version
         # Expected output:
         # Python 3.12.* or higher

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows PowerShell

      To install Python, download the installer from:
      `Windows Installer Python
      <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_.

      .. note::

        For other distributions, refer to your distribution's documentation.

      Once the installation has finished, check to make sure that it's using the correct version:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 --version
         # Expected output:
         # Python 3.12.* or higher

Step 2: Choose Install Folder
-------------------------------

Create a directory to install ``LEAP``. In this example, we'll use ``my_folder``.
To create this directory, open a terminal and type:

.. code:: bash

    mkdir my_folder
    cd my_folder

This directory will serve as the workspace where you install and manage the LEAP package.

Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment
--------------------------------------

When working with Python, it's best to create a virtual environment to keep your packages
separate from the system Python. 

.. md-tab-set::
  :class: custom-tab-set-style
  :name: installation_env

  .. md-tab-item:: MacOS

      You will want to use your same Python version so if you
      installed ``python3.12`` with the installer above, the command would be:

      .. code:: bash

        python3.x -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate

      where ``python3.x`` is your Python version. For example, if you installed Python with the installer
      above, you installed ``python3.12``, so the command would be:

      .. code:: bash

          python3.12 -m venv env
          source env/bin/activate

  .. md-tab-item:: Linux

      You will want to use your same Python version so if you
      installed ``python3.12`` with the installer above, the command would be:

      .. code:: bash

        python3.x -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate

      where ``python3.x`` is your Python version. For example, if you installed Python with the installer for v3.12, you installed ``python3.12``, so the command would be:

      .. code:: bash

          python3.12 -m venv env
          source env/bin/activate

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows Command Prompt

      .. code-block:: bash

        python -m venv env
        env\Scripts\activate

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows PowerShell

      .. code-block:: bash

          python -m venv env
          .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

      .. warning::

          For PowerShell, you may need to allow scripts temporarily:

          If you get an error, run ``Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process``
          before running ``.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1``


Step 4: (Optional) Setup Git Token
-----------------------------------

.. md-tab-set::
  :class: custom-tab-set-style
  :name: installation_git_token

  .. md-tab-item:: MacOS

      If you haven't used ``git`` on the command line before, you will need to set up a personal access
      token. This is so you can install the ``LEAP`` package from ``GitHub``. To do this:

      1. Go to `GitHub Settings: Tokens <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`_ to create a personal
         access token.
      2. Click on ``Tokens: classic`` and then ``Generate new token (classic)``.
      3. Set the expiration to ``No expiration`` so you don't have to do this again. If you want more
         security, set an earlier date.
      4. Tick all the boxes available, and click ``Generate token``.
      5. Copy this token to a secure file on your system. **You won't be shown it again.**
      6. In your terminal, type:

      .. code:: bash

          git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

  .. md-tab-item:: Linux

      If you haven't used ``git`` on the command line before, you will need to set up a personal access
      token. This is so you can install the ``LEAP`` package from ``GitHub``. To do this:

      1. Go to `GitHub Settings: Tokens <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`_ to create a personal
         access token.
      2. Click on ``Tokens: classic`` and then ``Generate new token (classic)``.
      3. Set the expiration to ``No expiration`` so you don't have to do this again. If you want more
         security, set an earlier date.
      4. Tick all the boxes available, and click ``Generate token``.
      5. Copy this token to a secure file on your system. **You won't be shown it again.**
      6. In your terminal, either type:

      .. code-block:: bash

          git config --global credential.helper cache

      Use this for temporary storage of credentials in memory (default 15 minutes). Add a note about
      setting a custom timeout with ``cache --timeout=3600`` for longer sessions.

      .. code-block:: bash

          git config --global credential.helper store

      Use this for persistent storage of credentials in plain text.

      .. warning::

          This command should only be used on trusted machines.
          Add a security warning that credentials are stored in ``~/.git-credentials`` 

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows Command Prompt

      If you haven't used ``git`` on the command line before, you will need to set up a personal access
      token. This is so you can install the ``LEAP`` package from ``GitHub``. To do this:

      1. Go to `GitHub Settings: Tokens <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`_ to create a personal
         access token.
      2. Click on ``Tokens: classic`` and then ``Generate new token (classic)``.
      3. Set the expiration to ``No expiration`` so you don't have to do this again. If you want more
         security, set an earlier date.
      4. Tick all the boxes available, and click ``Generate token``.
      5. Copy this token to a secure file on your system. **You won't be shown it again.**
      6. In your terminal, type:

      .. code-block:: bash

          git config --global credential.helper manager

      7. Test your setup by cloning a private repository or running a Git command like:

      .. code-block:: bash

          git ls-remote https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO.git

          # Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO with your GitHub username and a private repository name.

      *(Optional)* If you encounter issues, ensure that Git is installed on your system. You can download
      it from: `Git Downloads <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows PowerShell

      If you haven't used ``git`` on the command line before, you will need to set up a personal access
      token. This is so you can install the ``LEAP`` package from ``GitHub``. To do this:

      1. Go to `GitHub Settings: Tokens <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`_ to create a personal
         access token.
      2. Click on ``Tokens: classic`` and then ``Generate new token (classic)``.
      3. Set the expiration to ``No expiration`` so you don't have to do this again. If you want more
         security, set an earlier date.
      4. Tick all the boxes available, and click ``Generate token``.
      5. Copy this token to a secure file on your system. **You won't be shown it again.**
      6. In your terminal, type:

      .. code-block:: bash

          git config --global credential.helper manager

      7. Test your setup by cloning a private repository or running a Git command like:

      .. code-block:: bash

          git ls-remote https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO.git

          # Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO with your GitHub username and a private repository name.

      *(Optional)* If you encounter issues, ensure that Git is installed on your system. You can download
      it from: `Git Downloads <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.


Step 5: Install ``LEAP``
-------------------------------

To install the ``LEAP`` package, type:


.. md-tab-set::
  :class: custom-tab-set-style
  :name: installation_leap

  .. md-tab-item:: MacOS

      .. code-block:: bash

          pip3 install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git

  .. md-tab-item:: Linux

      .. code-block:: bash

          pip3 install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows Command Prompt

      .. code-block:: bash

          python -m pip install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows PowerShell

      .. code-block:: bash

          python -m pip install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git


To install a specific release, append ``@vx.y.z`` at the end:

.. md-tab-set::
  :class: custom-tab-set-style
  :name: installation_leap_version

  .. md-tab-item:: MacOS

      .. code-block:: bash

          pip3 install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git@vx.y.z

  .. md-tab-item:: Linux

      .. code-block:: bash

          pip3 install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git@vx.y.z

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows Command Prompt

      .. code-block:: bash

          python -m pip install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git@vx.y.z

  .. md-tab-item:: Windows PowerShell

      .. code-block:: bash

          python -m pip install git+https://github.com/resplab/leap.git@vx.y.z


where ``vx.y.z`` is the release version you would like to install. To see all the releases, go to:
`LEAP Releases <https://github.com/resplab/leap/releases>`_.


*(Optional)* If you set up your ``git`` token in the last step, you will now be asked for you
username and password. Paste the token in as your password:

.. code:: bash

  Username for 'https://github.com': YOUR_GIT_USERNAME # not your email address
  Password: YOUR_TOKEN # not your GitHub password



Step 6: Install Success!
-------------------------

To verify the installation was a success, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    leap --help

After running ``leap --help``, you should see:

.. code-block:: bash

  usage: leap [-r] [-c CONFIG] [-p PROVINCE] [-ma MAX_AGE] [-my MIN_YEAR] [-th TIME_HORIZON]
              [-gt POPULATION_GROWTH_TYPE] [-nb NUM_BIRTHS_INITIAL] [-ip] [-o PATH_OUTPUT] [-f]
              [-v] [-h]

  options:
      -r, --run-simulation  Run the simulation.

  ARGUMENTS:
      ...

Now that you've successfully installed the ``LEAP`` package, you can start using it. To get
started, see the :doc:`Command-Line Interface <cli/index>` documentation.

To get out of the virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

  deactivate

If you want to develop this package, please see the installation instructions for
developers: :doc:`Developer Installation <../dev/dev-installation>`.



Troubleshooting
****************

- If ``python3 --version`` does not return Python 3.12 or higher, ensure Python 3.12 is installed
  and that the ``python3`` command points to the correct version.
- If ``pip`` is not installed, you can install it manually:

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
