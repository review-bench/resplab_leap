Hospitalization Data
***********************

The data is from the ``Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB)`` from the
`Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) 
<https://www.cihi.ca/en/hospital-morbidity-database-hmdb-metadata>`_.

The hospitalization data was collected from patients presenting to a hospital in Canada
due to an asthma exacerbation. We will use this data to calibrate the exacerbation model.

The hospitalization rate in this table is the hospitalization rate per 100 000 people.
For example, in the category ``F_90+``, the value would be the number of people hospitalized who
are female and over 90 during the given year. This can be calculated:

.. math::
        
    \text{rate} = \dfrac{\text{count}}{N} \times 100000

Model
======

The number of exacerbations in a given time interval is modelled using a Poisson distribution.
The formula is:

.. math::

    N_{\text{exacerbations}} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda) = \dfrac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}


Here :math:`\lambda` is the expected number of exacerbations per time interval. To obtain
:math:`\lambda`, we must perform a Poisson regression. The Poisson regression assumes that the value
we are interested in can be approximated using the following formula:

.. math::

    \ln(\lambda) = \ln(\alpha) + \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^3 \beta_i c_i 


where:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Description
   * - :math:`\alpha`
     - the calibration multiplier that adjusts the model to match the hospitalization data
   * - :math:`\beta_0`
     - a constant randomly chosen from the normal distribution :math:`\mathcal{N}(0, 1)`
   * - :math:`c_i`
     - relative time spent in control level :math:`i`
   * - :math:`\beta_i`
     - control level constant calculated from the :ref:`Control Model <control-model>`

To calculate the :math:`\beta_i` values, we consider the discrete random variable :math:`S`, which
is the severity of an asthma exacerbation, and the continuous random variable :math:`R`, which is
the rate of exacerbations per time interval.

Calibration
******************

We are interested in calculating :math:`\alpha`. If we rewrite the equation, the meaning of
:math:`\alpha` becomes more apparent:

.. math::

    \lambda = \alpha \cdot e^{\beta_0} \prod_{i=1}^3 e^{\beta_i c_i} 


How do we obtain :math:`\alpha`? We again assume that the mean value has the same form as in a
Poisson regression, with the following formula:

.. math::

    \ln(\lambda_{C}) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \beta_i c_i 


* :math:`\lambda_C`: the average number of exacerbations in a given time interval
* :math:`c_i`: relative time spent in control level :math:`i`
* :math:`\beta_i`: control level constant

Here, the :math:`\beta_i` values were calculated from the
`Economic Burden of Asthma (EBA) study <https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/9/e003360.long>`_
and are given by:

.. math::

    \beta_1 &:= \ln(0.1880058) \\
    \beta_2 &:= \ln(0.3760116) \\
    \beta_3 &:= \ln(0.5640174) 


The number of exacerbations predicted by the model is then:

.. math::

    N_{\text{exac}}^{\text{(pred)}} &= \lambda_C \cdot N_{\text{asthma}} \\
    N_{\text{asthma}} &= N \cdot \eta_{\text{prev}}

* :math:`N_{\text{asthma}}`: the number of people in a given time interval, age, sex with asthma
* :math:`N`: the number of people in a given time interval, age, and sex
* :math:`\eta_{\text{prev}}`: the prevalence of asthma in a given time interval, age, and sex, from
  :ref:`occurrence-model-1`

and number of hospitalizations is:

.. math::

    N_{\text{hosp}}^{\text{(pred)}} = N_{\text{exac}}^{\text{(pred)}} \cdot P(\text{hosp})


* :math:`N_{\text{exac}}^{\text{(pred)}}`: the predicted number of exacerbations (of any severity)
  for a given time interval, age, and sex
* :math:`P(\text{hosp})`: the probability of hospitalization due to asthma given the patient has an
  asthma exacerbation

Finally, :math:`\alpha` can be computed:

.. math::

    \alpha(a, s, y) = \dfrac{N_{\text{hosp}}(a, s, y)}{N_{\text{hosp}}^{\text{(pred)}}(a, s, y)}
